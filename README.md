# Ulysses

This is where I track my progress in reading Ulysses by James Joyce.

## Cast of Characters
As Joyce tried to map the story on the epic poem the Oddysey by Homer, I think some of the characters are being represented as parallels. This is my gut feeling so far (I've only read up to the Chapter Calypso): 

| name | nickname(s) | Homer's Oddysey
|------|-------------|---------|
|Stephen Dedalus | Kinch | Telemachus
|Malachi Mulligan | Buck | Hermes
|Haines | | -
|Mr Deasy | | Nestor
|Leopold Bloom | Poldy | Oddyseus
|Marion Bloom | Molly | Calypso

## Chapters

### Telemachus
Stephen Dedalus (SD) is rudely woken by his frienemy: Buck Mulligan, loud-mouthed "Usurper". SD lives in a fortress tower of some kind.

### Nestor
SD is teaching his class, and sort of tongue-in-cheek mocking the "dumb" kid in the classroom. Kids a relieved to leave the class room and SD goes over algebra with one of the children that stays behind.
SD goes over to Mr. Deasy to ask for a advance payment. (Antisemitic) Mr. Deasy rants about the current affairs, it is revealed in a rather funny way that SD has a lot of outstanding debts. 

### Proteus
Mainly a chapter about SD walkinb by the sea, lost in thought about everything and nothing. It quotes Greek, German, French and Latin works and is a chapter that is very hard to follow if you don't look up some of the references, because half of them are hidden in Prose/Poetry style stream-of-consciousness.

### Calypso
A new character enters the scene, this is the first non-Stephen Dedalus point-of-view chapter. Being from Leopold Bloom's point-of-view this time. Leopold Bloom converses with his cat and is very inquisitive of all things in life, most of his thoughts end with questions about how things work. Leopold is married to Marion 'Molly' Bloom. Quite a demanding woman, shouting from upstairs how 'Poldy' should brew tea and pointing at objects, non-verbally summoning them through Leopold.

Leopold "escapes" the house to fetch some kidney's, he likes the 'tang of faintly scented urine' that it gives to his palate. Whatever that may mean. He is very obsessed with offal and kidney's and the behinds of women in the street.
He escapes the house one more time to go for a stroll to the outhouse.
